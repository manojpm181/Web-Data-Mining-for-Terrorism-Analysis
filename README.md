This project uses web mining methods to find and investigate web activities linked to terrorism. Web mining is the process of getting valuable data from web data like web pages, links, text, and use patterns. Web data mining for terrorism analysis can help find possible terrorists, keep an eye on what they do online, follow their contact networks, and stop attacks before they happen. To complete this final-year project, you must have a firm grasp of Python and web scraping.
